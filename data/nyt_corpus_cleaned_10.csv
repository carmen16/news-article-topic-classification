sports,"twelve hours earlier , harlem -- its bars and its restaurants , its living rooms and its sidewalks -- crackled with sweet satisfaction . the neighborhood 's baseball team had , in dramatic fashion and in extra innings , qualified for the little league world series for the first time . but yesterday afternoon , as word filtered through the streets that little league officials were investigating whether three players on the team lived outside the designated harlem district and were thus ineligible , the mood had become angry , suspicious and colored by a kind of fatalism . there was talk of racial motivations and silly standards , of denying a dream to a player merely because he lived 10 blocks north of harlem 's official boundaries . at nikkis , a bar at st . nicholas avenue and 125th street , the happy hour crowd trickled in and conversation was dominated by how a new york city team might be denied a chance in williamsport , pa . , for what many deemed a technicality . `` come on , this is ridiculous , '' tesha thompkins said , taking a break from tending bar . `` i do n't think it is fair . the team is giving these kids hopes and dreams , and now they are going to be crushed . '' relatives and friends and school records indicate that three players on the team , including two star pitchers , lived either in the bronx or in washington heights for at least parts of the year . but little league officials in pennsylvania said they would allow the harlem team 's officials to try to demonstrate that the players are eligible . fritz johnson , who nursed a cocktail at the bar , chimed in . `` it seems like when kids from harlem start getting ahead someone has to go and push them back down , '' johnson said . `` they are just trying to find fault . who cares where they are from ? do all the yankees come from new york city ?

'' in washington heights , where andrew diaz , one of the players whose eligibility has come under questioning , appears to live , boys who live and breathe baseball said they had been hoping the harlem team 's triumph would wash away the taint of last year 's disaster , when it turned out that danny almonte , the star pitcher on the bronx team that made it to the series , was over age . `` after last year it would be good to win , '' said emmanuel alvarado , who is 13 and lives on west 170th street . he sometimes plays basketball with diaz , he said . like many boys in that heavily dominican neighborhood , he is passionate about baseball , cradling his glove like a kitten in his hand . `` harlem is not so far from here , '' he said . `` they should just let him play . '' miguel santana , 15 , said boys from his neighborhood who are serious about little league often choose to travel south to harlem . `` the league here is n't so good , so some guys go to harlem , '' santana said . `` in harlem they are more organized and you get to go on trips and stuff . '' in hunts point , the bronx , where alibay barkley and jeremy lopez lived , friends and acquaintances said they were both proud of the boys ' accomplishments and perturbed by what some called racially motivated attempts to tarnish them . at first , many people volunteered that they knew the two , whom they called constant companions who lived on the same floor in the same apartment building . many children , in particular , pointed without hesitation at their building , 941 faile street , which is across the street from p . p ./ p . p . 75 , where barkley attends school . on many afternoons , they said , one could find the two playing catch or taking batting practice in the school 's parking lot . as the day wore on , however , and television news vans began arriving , many neighbors said that the two boys were among the many urban children who shuttle among relatives ' places around the city . they noted that children do live with , for example , a grandmother one year , an aunt the next , then switch back to their mother the following year , all while staying in the same school to keep the same friends and some sense of continuity . besides , even if the boys wanted to play baseball in hunts point , some people said , there were few opportunities , because of a paucity of ballparks and organized baseball . `` it does n't matter where they live , '' said michael rodriguez , 21. `` if they play a good game , leave it at that . at least they 're not selling drugs or hurting anybody . '' and just as in harlem , some neighbors said that the controversy was inextricably entwined with race . `` they 're always going to pick on minorities , '' said carlos rivera , 32. `` they ca n't accept that a minority team can play with a white team . since harlem made it , all of a sudden it 's a controversy .

'' and `` genius ! '' so that her rapture was almost an unconscious thing . when a model came out cloaked in mossy green velvet , ms . mellen drew back , gasped and whispered , `` is that giselle ? '' ms . mellen smiled . `` yes , it is giselle , '' she said , her voice settling like butterflies on a branch . in a way , what ms . mellen and her fashion sisters want -- indeed , what anyone who cares about fashion wants -- is a sense of crossing a frontier . they want to stand on the edge of something , to look out across a forbidding plain of new styles , and experience emotionally what is essentially an optimistic undertaking . is it a coincidence that the least dreamy expressions of the millennium seen this week have belonged to the women -- veronique branquinho , ann demeulemeester , martine sitbon and rei kawakubo of comme des garcons -- rather than to the men ? alexander mcqueen , for example , staged his givenchy show wednesday with models in martian pancake and frizzled wigs walking robotlike down a mirrored runway beaming with airport lights . the collection vividly showcased mr . mcqueen 's laser - sharp tailoring -- lunar - white trouser suits with crosses etched out in gray fur , slick coats with the couture equivalent of clear plastic upholstery covers , silvery leathers and a molded red top that would enhance any alien bosom . ms . sitbon 's message was far more thoughtful and deliberate , and in its unsentimental refusal to look backward or too far ahead , modern . she opened her show wednesday with a high - necked black jersey dress , inset on one side with a panel of gathered cream jersey , and proceeded to play with that theme , sending out pleated black satin skirts with panels of white , some with a graphic band of orange shooting around the hips like a dan flavin neon sculpture . there were leather skirts with papery flower cut - outs at the hem and trousers slopping guilelessly over the shoes , a ubiquitous style this season . but it was in her ingenious use of black decoration ribbon that ms . sitbon summed up a more sober era . drizzled on the front of a smocked white blouse , they looked like old love - letter ribbons . judging from her relentlessly plain collection of dark blazers and plaid schoolgirl skirts hiked above one knee with a strap from the waist , ms . branquinho must be a very hard woman . to her , everything is a nail , and she keeps hammering it until you eventually grasp that ms . branquinho , who is young and belgian and apparently shy , is taking on the most cherished of female symbols : the skirt . she treats it with playful indifference , lifting it above an underskirt of humble gray cotton or a pair of thick leggings , and showing its variations with snug jackets and sweaters , including a purple turtleneck with unknitted strings of yarn hanging down the front . this season , ms . demeulemeester finessed the well - cut black pants suits for which she is known , and went celtic . that meant brown and gray pinstriped wool dresses wrapped in bunchy folds and asymmetrical lengths around the body ; ribbed trousers and loose jackets in rough - looking fabrics for her long - haired guys , and shearling in maxi vests and cave - dweller ponchos . ms . kawakubo is hardly anyone 's idea of fun and games . her shows tend to be serious , churchlike affairs , with tricky clothes that perennially test the fashion world 's indulgence . but on tuesday night in her showroom in the place vendome , it was ms . kawakubo who had the last laugh . she opened with some elaborately wrapped dresses in vivid yellow and red plaid that immediately brought to mind vivienne westwood , tartan queen . judy collinson , the general merchandising manager of barneys new york , which sells comme des garcons , thought she detected parody , too . and then out came a fussy brocade dress , cut kimono - style , with an enormous bow . `` saint laurent ?
