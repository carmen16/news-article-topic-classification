" Harlem (NYC) community blames discrimination and semantics for inquiry into Harlem Little League team, on it's way to Little League World Series; team is being questioned about members' adherance to age and district requirements; photo (M)",,The New York Times,2002,,Sports Desk," Twelve hours earlier, Harlem -- its bars and its restaurants, its living rooms and its sidewalks -- crackled with sweet satisfaction. The neighborhood's baseball team had, in dramatic fashion and in extra innings, qualified for the Little League World Series for the first time. But yesterday afternoon, as word filtered through the streets that Little League officials were investigating whether three players on the team lived outside the designated Harlem district and were thus ineligible, the mood had become angry, suspicious and colored by a kind of fatalism. There was talk of racial motivations and silly standards, of denying a dream to a player merely because he lived 10 blocks north of Harlem's official boundaries. At Nikkis, a bar at St. Nicholas Avenue and 125th Street, the happy hour crowd trickled in and conversation was dominated by how a New York City team might be denied a chance in Williamsport, Pa., for what many deemed a technicality. ''Come on, this is ridiculous,'' Tesha Thompkins said, taking a break from tending bar. ''I don't think it is fair. The team is giving these kids hopes and dreams, and now they are going to be crushed.'' Relatives and friends and school records indicate that three players on the team, including two star pitchers, lived either in the Bronx or in Washington Heights for at least parts of the year. But Little League officials in Pennsylvania said they would allow the Harlem team's officials to try to demonstrate that the players are eligible. Fritz Johnson, who nursed a cocktail at the bar, chimed in. ''It seems like when kids from Harlem start getting ahead someone has to go and push them back down,'' Johnson said. ''They are just trying to find fault. Who cares where they are from? Do all the Yankees come from New York City?'' Eddie Tookes, who sat at an adjacent table, felt similarly. ''I mean, where does Harlem start and where does it end?'' he said. ''You've got East Harlem and West Harlem, and North Harlem, too. It's kind of flexible, and I think the kids should get the benefit of the doubt.'' A few blocks away at Bobby's Happy House, a music store, Al Irick seethed. ''If a kid is from the South Bronx, what's the big difference?'' he said, pounding a fist into his palm. ''When it comes to us black folks, they are always finding fault. They always want to look under the rug. They should just let the kids play.'' In Washington Heights, where Andrew Diaz, one of the players whose eligibility has come under questioning, appears to live, boys who live and breathe baseball said they had been hoping the Harlem team's triumph would wash away the taint of last year's disaster, when it turned out that Danny Almonte, the star pitcher on the Bronx team that made it to the series, was over age. ''After last year it would be good to win,'' said Emmanuel Alvarado, who is 13 and lives on West 170th Street. He sometimes plays basketball with Diaz, he said. Like many boys in that heavily Dominican neighborhood, he is passionate about baseball, cradling his glove like a kitten in his hand. ''Harlem is not so far from here,'' he said. ''They should just let him play.'' Miguel Santana, 15, said boys from his neighborhood who are serious about Little League often choose to travel south to Harlem. ''The league here isn't so good, so some guys go to Harlem,'' Santana said. ''In Harlem they are more organized and you get to go on trips and stuff.'' In Hunts Point, the Bronx, where Alibay Barkley and Jeremy Lopez lived, friends and acquaintances said they were both proud of the boys' accomplishments and perturbed by what some called racially motivated attempts to tarnish them. At first, many people volunteered that they knew the two, whom they called constant companions who lived on the same floor in the same apartment building. Many children, in particular, pointed without hesitation at their building, 941 Faile Street, which is across the street from P.S./M.S. 75, where Barkley attends school. On many afternoons, they said, one could find the two playing catch or taking batting practice in the school's parking lot. As the day wore on, however, and television news vans began arriving, many neighbors said that the two boys were among the many urban children who shuttle among relatives' places around the city. They noted that children do live with, for example, a grandmother one year, an aunt the next, then switch back to their mother the following year, all while staying in the same school to keep the same friends and some sense of continuity. Besides, even if the boys wanted to play baseball in Hunts Point, some people said, there were few opportunities, because of a paucity of ballparks and organized baseball. ''It doesn't matter where they live,'' said Michael Rodriguez, 21. ''If they play a good game, leave it at that. At least they're not selling drugs or hurting anybody.'' And just as in Harlem, some neighbors said that the controversy was inextricably entwined with race. ''They're always going to pick on minorities,'' said Carlos Rivera, 32. ''They can't accept that a minority team can play with a white team. Since Harlem made it, all of a sudden it's a controversy.'' A few neighbors, like Christopher Osorio, 12, said there was no excuse that could justify cheating. ''You have to live in the same borough,'' he said. ''That's cheating the system, because you're saying one thing, and you're doing something else against the rules.''

 Cathy Horyn reviews Paris fashion shows; photos (M),,The New York Times,1999,,Style Desk," Getting into the Chloe show was difficult enough, what with the crush of television cameras, the snagging cascades of vines and one hysterical French fashion editor. But then, there she was. Not a flaming rock star. Not a bosomy actress. Not even Jerry Hall, who's in town. ''Yes, it is her,'' said an equally surprised Patrick McCarthy of Women's Wear Daily, as an editor stopped dead in her tracks before Camilla Parker-Bowles, the companion of Prince Charles, who was front and center Wednesday in a demure dark suit at the Chloe show. What Mrs. Parker-Bowles was doing at a French fashion show was not clear, but suffice it to say that her presence added a strange, if frenetic, sense of English bonhomie at Chloe, which is designed by Stella McCartney. Her father, Sir Paul McCartney, was there, and as he took his seat across form Mrs. Parker-Bowles, he was greeted with a hug from the singer Marianne Faithfull. Ms. McCartney has come into her own as a designer, mixing strong tailoring with a louche club style. Out came glossy denim trousers with nail-head tigers on the rear, and lacy camisoles, a Chloe signature, followed by Stella Tennant in a razor-sharp gray herringbone pants suit with creamy lace worked into the lapels. Ms. McCartney's real strength is mixing separates, like a heathery tweed bustier over a cream off-the-shoulder sweater, the way her London girlfriends might. For the first time in recent memory, none of the editors in chief of the top American fashion monthlies were here, not Anna Wintour of Vogue or Elizabeth Tilberis of Harper's Bazaar or Bonnie Fuller of Glamour. But nearly all were at the Italian shows, an acknowledgment of Milan's advertising clout. ''It's business, baby,'' said Polly Mellen, an Allure editor who did come to Paris. But Paris. How can one explain the effect this city has on fashion people, editors, retailers and hangers-on, who after six straight days of staring at clothes in Milan come here and feel alive; who start combing their hair differently and think maybe they'll buy that coat with the Mongolian lamb fluffing madly from the collar after all; who run over to some place near the Bastille called Purple, a kind of gallery of new style -- people who, in effect, live to ''die'' for fashion 24 hours a day. Well, you can't explain it without sounding like some poor old weepy gal planted like a fir tree under Serge Gainsbourg's window. Sitting in the front row the other day at the Yohji Yamamoto show, Ms. Mellen, who began her career in the Diana Vreeland era of exploding exclamation points, was utterly absorbed, muttering to herself such words as ''Divine!'' and ''Genius!''  so that her rapture was almost an unconscious thing. When a model came out cloaked in mossy green velvet, Ms. Mellen drew back, gasped and whispered, ''Is that Giselle?'' Ms. Mellen smiled. ''Yes, it is Giselle,'' she said, her voice settling like butterflies on a branch. In a way, what Ms. Mellen and her fashion sisters want -- indeed, what anyone who cares about fashion wants -- is a sense of crossing a frontier. They want to stand on the edge of something, to look out across a forbidding plain of new styles, and experience emotionally what is essentially an optimistic undertaking. Is it a coincidence that the least dreamy expressions of the millennium seen this week have belonged to the women -- Veronique Branquinho, Ann Demeulemeester, Martine Sitbon and Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons -- rather than to the men? Alexander McQueen, for example, staged his Givenchy show Wednesday with models in Martian pancake and frizzled wigs walking robotlike down a mirrored runway beaming with airport lights. The collection vividly showcased Mr. McQueen's laser-sharp tailoring -- lunar-white trouser suits with crosses etched out in gray fur, slick coats with the couture equivalent of clear plastic upholstery covers, silvery leathers and a molded red top that would enhance any alien bosom. Ms. Sitbon's message was far more thoughtful and deliberate, and in its unsentimental refusal to look backward or too far ahead, modern. She opened her show Wednesday with a high-necked black jersey dress, inset on one side with a panel of gathered cream jersey, and proceeded to play with that theme, sending out pleated black satin skirts with panels of white, some with a graphic band of orange shooting around the hips like a Dan Flavin neon sculpture. There were leather skirts with papery flower cut-outs at the hem and trousers slopping guilelessly over the shoes, a ubiquitous style this season. But it was in her ingenious use of black decoration ribbon that Ms. Sitbon summed up a more sober era. Drizzled on the front of a smocked white blouse, they looked like old love-letter ribbons. Judging from her relentlessly plain collection of dark blazers and plaid schoolgirl skirts hiked above one knee with a strap from the waist, Ms. Branquinho must be a very hard woman. To her, everything is a nail, and she keeps hammering it until you eventually grasp that Ms. Branquinho, who is young and Belgian and apparently shy, is taking on the most cherished of female symbols: the skirt. She treats it with playful indifference, lifting it above an underskirt of humble gray cotton or a pair of thick leggings, and showing its variations with snug jackets and sweaters, including a purple turtleneck with unknitted strings of yarn hanging down the front. This season, Ms. Demeulemeester finessed the well-cut black pants suits for which she is known, and went Celtic. That meant brown and gray pinstriped wool dresses wrapped in bunchy folds and asymmetrical lengths around the body; ribbed trousers and loose jackets in rough-looking fabrics for her long-haired guys, and shearling in maxi vests and cave-dweller ponchos. Ms. Kawakubo is hardly anyone's idea of fun and games. Her shows tend to be serious, churchlike affairs, with tricky clothes that perennially test the fashion world's indulgence. But on Tuesday night in her showroom in the Place Vendome, it was Ms. Kawakubo who had the last laugh. She opened with some elaborately wrapped dresses in vivid yellow and red plaid that immediately brought to mind Vivienne Westwood, tartan queen. Judy Collinson, the general merchandising manager of Barneys New York, which sells Comme des Garcons, thought she detected parody, too. And then out came a fussy brocade dress, cut kimono-style, with an enormous bow. ''Saint Laurent?'' Ms. Collinson conjectured. But of course. It was a wonderful parody of a fashion show, right down to the bright red runway, the nunlike procession of the models (without music), and the over-the-top western shoes in hot rodeo colors. But it was for fashion's glittery gaucheness that Ms. Kawakubo reserved her sharpest dart. She sent out a long black coat, perfectly beautiful, with folds of wool rising up toward the chin and a large safety pin holding the thing closed. It was all very lovely, Japanese and reverent -- until the model turned and, from beneath the deep vent, flashed a pair of iridescent gold bloomers straight out of Vegas. Brilliant. Elsewhere on the Paris runways, Emanuel Ungaro showed one of his better collections in a while. It was full of gypsy skirts and folkloric prints, and included some terrific jackets in wine and lavender suede with Mongolian trim that his customers can wear with plain trousers. Issey Miyake's was typically inventive, with egg-shaped pleated coats and papery-looking dresses that resembled crushed flowers (or a dried spitball, if you like), but there was no real news. As for Ronald Van der Kemp's debut collection today for Guy Laroche, it was heavy on the sort of colorful, sparkling clothes that women who don't have great expectations about fashion usually find thrilling. Nicolas Ghesquiere, on the other hand, bears watching. His Balenciaga show today was genuine and poetic, with high-necked coats, modern cuts and tight leather sleeves pushed up the arms. It made one think of what fashion-besotted convent girls would do if they got their hands on the priests' frocks.",['Apparel'],Review/Fashion; Down to Earth in Paris,1091732,"['Apparel', 'Reviews']",Paris (France),,"Horyn, Cathy"," Getting into the Chloe show was difficult enough, what with the crush of television cameras, the snagging cascades of vines and one hysterical French fashion editor.

,,The New York Times,1988,,Editorial Desk," LEAD: Dartmouth College has begun its fall term with a week-long celebration of its 15th anniversary of coeducation. During the opening ceremony, which I was privileged to attend, Scott Sims, the student leader chosen to address the convocation, told me that he plans to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Dartmouth College has begun its fall term with a week-long celebration of its 15th anniversary of coeducation. During the opening ceremony, which I was privileged to attend, Scott Sims, the student leader chosen to address the convocation, told me that he plans to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. ''Did you try for it when you were a senior?'' he asked. He was astonished when I told him no women were accepted when I was finishing college. He had sung with pride the new Dartmouth alma mater song, which no longer has anything about ''Frenchmen and Indians'' and includes the lines, ''for the sons of old Dartmouth, for the daughters of Dartmouth.'' Apparently some old grads complained when it was introduced, but it's taken for granted now. What seems a long time ago to the current crop in college is really quite recent. Some things have changed significantly in a generation. A professor remembered that she was one of the first women admitted to the faculty, a little more than 20 years ago, and then was excluded from the regular faculty lunch of her department because it was quite enough for a woman to be allowed to teach. She couldn't expect to join in discussions of department business. A male professor suggested that now the word coeducation should be considered obsolete. It's just education. Why are males at college ''students'' and females at college ''coeds''? I went to U.C.L.A., which as a state university was always coeducational, and it never occurred to us that it was odd for only women to be called ''coeds.'' In fact, there was a high percentage of women because it had begun as a teacher training college, and at lower levels, teaching had long been considered a suitable female profession. But others were not. Provoked by a high school teacher who urged the class to think of an occupation and to write off to inquire about the necessary preparation, I had asked the State Department how to apply for the Foreign Service. That was not long before World War II. The answer came with a series of sample examinations of the type that had to be passed, and a long letter. It began: ''While we are forbidden by law to refuse to consider women, you will understand that you will automatically be marked down 20 percent in the orals.'' Since it added that only the top 20 percent of those who take the exams would be eligible for appointment, obviously a woman would have to be almost perfect on the written tests. Even then, it went on: ''For the following 27 reasons, it is difficult for us to assign posts to women.'' Among the reasons were that some countries did not welcome women diplomats, others might be too dangerous, and there was a series of essentially frivolous arguments and cliches. If, the letter continued, no assignment has been made at the end of two years, you can reapply and take the examinations once more, but only once more. As I started work as a newspaperwoman before I reached the minimum age to apply, I never found out what might have happened. Nor did I regret it. But Dartmouth reminded me what it was like to have to take closed doors as a given. And it reminded me that the assumption of blocked opportunity isn't over yet. Three young women in a row interviewed me for local media. Each one wanted to know, ''What is it like to be a woman journalist?'' They didn't mean, what is it like to be a woman. They know about that. Do they ask men, ''What is it like to be a man journalist''? A black woman who was escorting me said she understood my irritation. She got the same kind of question on race. ''What is it like to be a black journalist?'' What it's supposed to be like is to do your job like everybody else. The chances have vastly improved for both of us, more for me than for her, but then I am a good deal older. After all, Dartmouth with some 40 percent women undergraduates and still a top reputation has shown that the adjustment needn't be nearly so hard as stubborn tradition tried to make it. Some things don't change much. The big campus issue now is student resentment of a ruling by the board of trustees that freshmen can't join fraternities or sororities and must await their second year. There's something to be said for that, but even more to be said for the idea that the board should include a student representative. The trivial and the earnest persist side by side, and they always will. In jerks and fits, the society is moving to confront responsibilities. The big debate about the approach to college education remains necessary. Dartmouth reflects that we have come a ways toward being serious about opportunity, and that we still have a good way to go.

,,The New York Times,1987,,Financial Desk," LEAD: Ilan K. Reich, a 32-year-old former partner with one of the nation's top law firms, was sentenced yesterday in an emotional court session to a year and a day in prison for his role in the Wall Street insider trading scandal. Ilan K. Reich, a 32-year-old former partner with one of the nation's top law firms, was sentenced yesterday in an emotional court session to a year and a day in prison for his role in the Wall Street insider trading scandal. Mr. Reich, who had been a specialist on mergers and acquisitions at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, was charged with having provided tips on several pending corporate takeovers to Dennis B. Levine, a former investment banker who has pleaded guilty to charges that he illegally traded on inside information through a Bahamian bank account. Mr. Reich became the third person to be sentenced in the case, and the third person to receive a jail term. The addition of the day to the year-long sentence means that Mr. Reich will be eligible for parole after one-third of his term is served. Federal District Judge Robert Sweet also sentenced Mr. Reich to five years of probation. Mr. Reich had pleaded guilty to two felony counts and could have faced as much as 10 years in prison. Judge Sweet said that a jail sentence was necessary because of the enormous breach of integrity demonstrated by the offense. ''You are a symbol of the sickness in our society,'' the judge said in a statement that included quotations from Proust and other authors. In court yesterday, Mr. Reich asked that a prison sentence not be imposed, saying that his highly promising career had been ruined and he felt that he had suffered enough. Mr. Reich's attorney, Robert Morvillo, told the court that his client had received no money from his dealings with Mr. Levine. Mr. Reich's pregnant wife was in the courtroom and wept during the sentencing. Even though he sent Mr. Reich to prison, the judge indicated that he felt there were mitigating circumstances in the case. He said that he would personally back Mr. Reich if he sought to be reinstated to the bar after serving his sentence. The judge blamed Mr. Levine for Mr. Reich's difficulties, saying that Mr. Levine had solicited Mr. Reich's aid.","['Futures and Options Trading', 'Securities and Commodities Violations', 'Sentences (Criminal)', 'Ethics', 'Stocks and Bonds', 'Crime and Criminals', 'Finances']",PRISON TERM IMPOSED IN INSIDER CASE,6560,"['STOCKS AND BONDS', 'VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES REGULATIONS', 'INSIDERS INFORMATION', 'SENTENCES (CRIMINAL)', 'ETHICS']",,WACHTELL LIPTON ROSEN & KATZ,"REICH, ILAN K"," LEAD: Ilan K.
